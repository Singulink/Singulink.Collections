**Singulink.Collections** provides generally useful collections that are missing from .NET. They are highly optimized for performance, well documented and follow the same design principles as the built-in collections so they should feel instantly familiar.

The following collections are included in the package:
- `HashSetDictionary`: Collection of keys and hash sets of unique values (per key).
- `ListDictionary`: Collection of keys and lists of values.
- `Map`: Collection of two types of values that map between each other in a bidirectional one-to-one relationship.
- `ReadOnlyHashSet`: Read-only wrapper around a HashSet.
- `ReadOnlyList`: Read-only wrapper around a List.
